## Data Fetching & Promises

Data fetching refers to the process of retrieving data from external sources, such as APIs or databases. In JavaScript, data fetching is commonly done using HTTP requests to fetch data from web APIs. Promises are a built-in JavaScript feature that allows asynchronous operations, such as data fetching, to be handled more easily. Promises represent the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and allow you to work with asynchronous data in a more structured and readable manner.

## Destructuring Data

Destructuring is a JavaScript feature that allows you to extract individual values from objects or arrays and assign them to variables in a concise way. It provides a convenient syntax to extract and use specific properties or elements from complex data structures. This can make your code more readable and reduce the need for repetitive property or element access.

## Async

The `async` keyword is used in JavaScript to declare an asynchronous function. An asynchronous function returns a promise, allowing you to use `await` within the function to pause its execution until a promise is resolved or rejected. This simplifies working with asynchronous operations, such as fetching data, by providing a more synchronous-looking code structure.

## Modules

Modules in JavaScript are a way to organize and encapsulate code. They allow you to split your code into separate files, making it more modular and reusable. JavaScript modules use the `import` and `export` keywords to define dependencies between files and expose specific functionality to be used in other parts of your codebase. Modules help in structuring large-scale applications and promote code maintainability and reusability.
