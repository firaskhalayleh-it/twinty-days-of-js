## Asynchronous Programming in JavaScript

In this session, Will Sentance introduces the concept of asynchronous programming in JavaScript. He starts by discussing promises as an addition to the traditional ES5 callback model. Promises provide a way to handle asynchronous operations in a more readable and organized manner.

Will explains that JavaScript's asynchronicity is what enables dynamic web applications and simultaneous operations in a single-threaded language. He mentions the event loop, which determines the order of code execution, and the micro task queue, an important aspect of web browser features.

The session then dives into the execution of regular code, where data is stored in global memory. Constants and functions are defined, and function results are stored in variables. New execution contexts are created for function calls, and the code inside functions is executed. Once the function code is completed, the execution context is closed, and the program moves to the next line of code.

Finally, the session covers the declaration and assignment of values to new variables.

Overall, this session provides an overview of the key concepts and mechanisms involved in asynchronous programming in JavaScript.




In this code explanation, the focus is on understanding how JavaScript interacts with the web browser features. The code example uses the `setTimeout` function, which is a web browser feature labeled in JavaScript. It sets up a timer that will trigger the execution of a function after a specified delay.

Here's a summary of the code execution:

```javascript
// Define the printHello function
function printHello() {
  console.log("Hello");
}

// Set up a timer using setTimeout
setTimeout(printHello, 1000);

// Log "Me first" to the console
console.log("Me first");
```

The execution flows as follows:

1. The `printHello` function is defined in JavaScript.
2. The `setTimeout` function is called, which sets up a timer in the web browser for 1000 milliseconds (1 second).
3. The timer starts running in the background while JavaScript continues executing.
4. The JavaScript code moves on to the next line, which logs "Me first" to the console.
5. Time continues to pass in the web browser.
6. After 1000 milliseconds, the timer in the web browser is complete.
7. The `printHello` function is executed and the message "Hello" is logged to the console.

It's important to note that the `setTimeout` function and other web browser features are not part of JavaScript itself but are accessible through JavaScript as facade functions. Understanding this interaction between JavaScript and the web browser features helps explain the behavior of asynchronous operations in JavaScript.

This diagram illustrates the flow of execution in the code example. The `setTimeout` function is called, which sets up a timer in the web browser. Meanwhile, the JavaScript code continues executing and logs "Me first" to the console. After the specified delay, the timer in the web browser triggers the execution of the `printHello` function, which logs "Hello" to the console.


Web browsers provide several features that enhance the capabilities of JavaScript within the browser environment:
