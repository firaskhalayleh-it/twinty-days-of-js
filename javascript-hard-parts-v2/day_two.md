# Closure in JavaScript
## introduction
- it enable us to not repeat calculations or tasks that take usually long time .
- every time function runs it creates a new local memory.after finish running code (return the value/result) it delete the exception context of it.

Closure is a powerful concept in JavaScript that enables the creation of professional-level functions and optimization techniques.
It allows functions to remember data from previous executions and facilitates the implementation of design patterns.
Understanding closure involves grasping local memory,execution context, and functions with memories. In summary, closure empowers developers to build advanced functions, optimize performance, and enhance code structure.
