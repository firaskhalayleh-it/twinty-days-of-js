## Function Declaration and Function Expression

| Function Declaration             | Function Expression                                    |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Defined with the `function` keyword followed by a name. | Defined by assigning an anonymous function to a variable. |
| Gets hoisted to the top of its scope.               | Does not get hoisted. It can only be used after its declaration. |
| Can be referenced inside its body.                  | May or may not reference itself (depends on its name). |

### Named Function Declaration Example
```javascript
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

### Named Function Expression Example
```javascript
const multiply = function multiply(a, b) {
  return a * b;
};
```

### Anonymous Function Expression Example
```javascript
const divide = function(a, b) {
  return a / b;
};
```

## Advantages of Named Functions

1. Reliable Function Self-Reference:
   Named functions allow for reliable self-reference, which is useful for recursion and maintaining a reference to the function itself.

2. More Debuggable Stack Traces:
   When an error occurs, a named function will show up with its name in the stack trace, making debugging easier.

3. More Self-Documenting Code:
   Named functions provide meaningful names that describe their purpose, making the code more self-explanatory.

## Stack Trace

A stack trace is a report that displays the sequence of function calls made by a program before an error occurs. It helps developers trace the flow of execution and identify the source of the error.

## Naming Named Function Expressions

When naming a function expression, it's important to avoid variable shadowing, which can lead to confusion and unexpected behavior. One way to ensure this is to use a unique name that is unlikely to collide with other variables in the same scope.

### Example of Naming Named Function Expressions
```javascript
const myModule = (function myUniqueModuleName() {
  // Module implementation
})();
```

## Dividing Complex Functions

When a function becomes too complex, it's beneficial to divide it into smaller, more manageable functions. This promotes code reusability, readability, and maintainability.

### Example of Dividing a Complex Function
```javascript
function processUserData(userData) {
  const validatedData = validateUserData(userData);
  const processedData = processData(validatedData);
  return processedData;
}
```

## Arrow Functions

Arrow functions provide a more concise syntax for writing functions and automatically bind the `this` value lexically. However, they can make code harder to read when used for longer and more complex functions.

## Comparison of Function Types

| Type                      | Hoisted | Self-Reference | Stack Trace   | Readability     |
|---------------------------|---------|----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Function Declaration      | Yes     | Yes            | Yes           | Good            |
| Named Function Expression | No      | Yes            | Yes           | Good            |
| Anonymous Function        | No      | No             | Yes           | Depends on Usage|
| Arrow Function            | No      | No             | Yes           | May be affected |

*(Note: "Readability" is subjective and may vary based on individual preferences and coding styles.)*

**Please note that the above comparison is a general guideline and may not apply to all scenarios. The choice of function type depends on the specific use case and code structure.**
